### Hi there, I'm Hamza Hassan 👋  
_A software (read: **Product**) engineer living one git-commit at a time._

With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in building and deploying software solutions in AI and SaaS. From designing secure backend systems to creating seamless user interfaces, I'm passionate about crafting high-quality software. Skilled in event-driven architecture, cloud infrastructure, and RLHF pipelines, I've worked on training and fine-tuning LLMs through human feedback, preference modeling, and Rubric design. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy learning new technologies.

Currently maintaining 2 open-source packages 👇

- [infra-foundry](https://github.com/0xhssn/infra-foundry), a platform-agnostic cloud infrastructure components library built with TypeScript and Pulumi, covering AWS, Cloudflare, and more.
- [jotai-transaction](https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-transaction), a utility package adding transaction support to [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) state management.

Contributions welcome!
